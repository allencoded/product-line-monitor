-- This script will convert the sensor_events table to a TimescaleDB hypertable
-- It needs to run AFTER Prisma creates the initial schema
-- For now, we'll handle this in a post-migration script

-- Note: This file is a placeholder. The actual hypertable conversion
-- will be done via a Prisma migration SQL file or a post-deploy script
